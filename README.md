# ECHO.

A forum dedicated to raising awareness about fake news while fostering critical thinking skills. Developed for Brainhack 2025 - CODE_EXP, Echo aligns with the hackathon's theme of fact-checking and verification by combining AI-powered content verification with community-driven consensus to amplify truth and combat misinformation.

## The Problem

7 in 10 Singaporeans have unknowingly spread fake news. 80% of Singaporeans are confident in spotting fake news, but 90% fail when tested. And our most digitally native generation, the Gen-Zs, spend over 2 Hours/Day on social media and are ironically, the most vulnerable to misinformation.

We needed an app that could not only keep up with the volume and the spread of falsehoods, but also engages, not just disseminate, while helping users pause, think and verify ambiguous claims on their own.

## Features

- User Authentication (Login/Register)
- Forum-style Home Feed with threads and engagement, featuring the week's highlights
- 'Dating apps' inspired swipes for Real / Fake voting of claims
- Search functionality alongside popular topics
- Thread creation with media upload, with immediate AI verification (DEFAME - https://github.com/multimodal-ai-lab/DEFAME) of claims.
- Leaderboard with user rankings
- User profiles with activity tracking, as well as personalised badges representing achievements

We used **React Native** for our front-end, **Firebase Authentication** for Authentication, and **Firestore Database** as our database.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
